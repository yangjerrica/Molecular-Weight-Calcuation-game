# Calculate 

## Molecular Weight Calculation Game



This game is designed for **junior high school students** who just started their Chemistry class and are still not 
familiar with basic molecular weight calculation. 

There will be three animals (dog, cat, and quokka) in this game. To win this game, the player has to make all three 
animals happy, by getting each question right. After he/she gets a question right, he/she will get to choose one of the 
treats (bone, fish, leaf, apple, carrot) to feed the animal. Each treat has different points of satisfaction and 
different emotions. To win the game all animals have to get 100 points of satisfaction.  

This project interests me because when I was a chemistry tutor back in Taiwan, students had to quickly calculate each 
molecular weight in order to finish all the questions under specific amount of time. Calculating molecular weight is the
most basic ability for students learning chemistry. By getting familiar with it, students can save multiple time during 
exams and work on harder problems. 


**Features**:

- random common molecules

- three animals (dog, cat, quokka)
 
- five treats (bone, fish, leaf, apple, carrot)
